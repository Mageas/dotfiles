# This script synchronizes Nix applications and icons to display in Gnome.
# It creates symbolic links in the user's local directories.

# Steps:
# 1. Synchronize application files by creating symbolic links in ~/.local/share/applications.
# 2. Synchronize icons of different sizes: 256x256, 512x512, scalable, symbolic.
